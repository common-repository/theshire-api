Theshire.co API is a data insert to automatically post links to your articles, blog posts, or reports on theshire.co news board 

== Description ==

This technology for the Theshire.co API is a Simple Object Access protocol (SOAP), which is an XML- and HTTP-based protocol.

Theshire.co Web Service API enables accredited news board users the ability to post links to their articles and reports without having to manually load them up on theshire.co. Any accredited news board user can use this API saving valuable time throughout the working day.

Accredited users must request to theshire.co admin for an API and setup. Details will be sent to the user by email. 

Steps :

 1. Sign up to theshire.co as a news media site and follow the step by step procedures to gain accreditation.


 2. Once theshire.co grants you accreditation to post links to your reports, blog posts, product reviews or interviews, click on the request API link.


 3. Once you receive by email from theshire.co containing the private key and public key details, activate this plugin.


 4.  After activating this plugin, you will need to enter required information like “Email address”, "private key" and "public key" that associated with your theshire.co user account.

Important*

When adding a new post in your Wordpress site, if you do not set a featured image to your article, theshire.co will automatically post a link to your report with your media site logo which you must add on your user profile background image. So make sure you have your logo set as your user background image on theshire.co


Important*

On your Wordpress page you must have a headline and provide an excerpt for your theshire.co link post to contain brief details of your content. If not, it will not look good and we may suspend your ability to use this API service.
